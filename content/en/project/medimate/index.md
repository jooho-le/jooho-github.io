title: MediMate
summary: MediMate is a web and mobile application designed for patients who have difficulty communicating during medical consultations. It allows patients to convey symptoms — such as where it hurts, how it feels, and since when — directly to doctors without the need for a guardian. The doctor’s medical notes are securely stored on the web platform, enabling both patients and their guardians to review them anytime. It serves as an assistive healthcare service improving independent medical accessibility.
